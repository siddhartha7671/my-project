            Prabhas Raju Uppalapati popularly known as Prabhas is a Tollywood actor and the nephew of Tollywood star and politician Krishnam Raju Uppalapati. Prabhas's early movies, Eeshwar and Raghavendra, did not fare very well at the box office, but he gained stardom with M.S. Raju's Varsham, opposite Trisha Krishnan, in 2004.

After the success of Varsham, Adavi Ramudu and Chakram did not live up to the expectations of Prabhas's fans. However, in September 2005, he made a comeback with the phenomenal blockbuster Chatrapathi, opposite actress Shriya Saran.

Chatrapati was followed by unsuccessful films such as Pournami, Yogi, and Munna. Munna also starred opposite Illeana Douglas. His Baahubali series made him one of the most popular faces in the Telugu film industry. He continues to have a large, loyal fan base among the Telugu people, especially among young women.

In 2015, he appeared as Shivudu (and Mahendra Baahubali) and Amarendra Baahubali in S.S. Rajamouli's epic Baahubali. The Beginning is the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film to date. Prabhas reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), which became the first Indian film ever to gross over 1,000 crores INR (US$155 million) in all languages in just ten days and is the second highest-grossing Indian film to date.
